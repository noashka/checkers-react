# Checkers

It's a simple checkers game app.

- [x] Implement basic game mechanics: taking turns, basic moves and jumps over the enemy checkers.
- [x] Players should be able to drag-n-drop checkers using a mouse. Additional ways to control the game are up to you.
- [x] On mouse over checker, please highlight cells where a checker can possibly move to.
- [x] If there is an opportunity to capture an enemy checker - it should be the only valid move.
- [x] No-brain AI player: could make a move to any random valid cell.
- [x] Please draw the board and checkers with DOM/CSS, donâ€™t use images or canvas for that part.
- [x] Make sure that the app is stable across major browsers.

- [x] Basic AI (making moves that are not completely random)
- [ ] Restoring the game state in case if a page was reloaded
- [ ] Reverting last move
- [x] Basic unit tests
- [ ] Better game stats UI (game time, number of moves, victory banners etc.)
- [x] King checkers mechanics (when a checker hits the last row and gets an ability to move backwards)
